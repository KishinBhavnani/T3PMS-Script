                <h1>The Story:</h1>
                <p>Water pollution has been becoming a major issue in the United States and around the world in the recent years.<br>
                   Water would be classified as being "polluted" when it does not support human use anymore or it undergoes a shift in its inbility to support biotic communitites.<br>
                   Water pollution affects the entire biosphere, plants, and organisms living in these bodies of water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and population, but also to the natural biological communities.<br>
                   It is estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness every day and about 90 percent of the water in the cities of China is polluted.<br>
                   in the most recent national report on water quality in the United States, 45 percent of assessed stream miles, 47% of assessed lake acres, and 32 percent of assessed bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted.<br>
                   Pollution from factories releases heavy metals like aluminum and nercury into the water which also causes water pollution.<br>
                <h1>What are the causes?</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chemical Waste</li>
                        <li>Radioactive Waste</li>
                        <li>Oil Pollution</li>
                        <li>Waste Water</li>
                        <li>Plastics</li>
                        <li>Sewage</li>
                    </ol>
                 <h1>How can we help limitate the amount of water pollution?</h1>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Education. By Educating and making people aware of the problem is the first step to solving it. Volunteer groups can set up informational meetings to inform people who are unaware of this issue and schools can inform children about the consequences of what will happen if they continue to pollute the water.</li><br>
                         <li>Laws. One of the biggest problems with water pollution is its transboundary nature. Many rivers cross countries, while seas span whole continents. Pollution discharged by factories in one country with poor environmental standards can cause problems in neighboring nations, even when they have tougher laws and higher standards. Environmental laws can make it tougher for people to pollute, but to be really effective they have to operate across national and international borders.</li><br>
                         <li>Economics.Life is ultimately about choicesâ€”and so is pollution. We can live with sewage-strewn beaches, dead rivers, and fish that are too poisonous to eat. Or we can work together to keep the environment clean so the plants, animals, and people who depend on it remain healthy. We can take individual action to help reduce water pollution, for example, by using environmentally friendly detergents, not pouring oil down drains, reducing pesticides, and so on. We can take community action too, by helping out on beach cleans or litter picks to keep our rivers and seas that little bit cleaner.</li><br>
